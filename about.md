Hi, I'm Sachin.

I work at the intersection of business and technology — designing systems, improving workflows, and supporting digital transformation initiatives.

After 20+ years in enterprise systems and telecom platforms, I’m now expanding into **Cloud** and **Generative AI** to build modern, intelligent solutions.

This blog is my learning journal — a space where I document concepts, insights, and experiments to help myself (and anyone on a similar journey) grow.

Thanks for visiting!
