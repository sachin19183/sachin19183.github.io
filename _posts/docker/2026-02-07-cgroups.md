If we imagine containers with only namespace and chroot, we are able to isolate processess and networking.
Imagine a setup where multiple containers are running. Chances are that:
- a single container can use 100% cpu
- another may consume entire RAM
This would mean that the host machine would become unusable as their is no limit set for each container on cpu/memory usage.
Google was facing similar challenges while managing their platform - BORG
So they build and contributed **cgroups** to the linux kernel.
cgroups is a linux kernel feature that lets you:
- Group processes
- Measure resource usage
- Limit resource consumption
- Prioritize workloads

In simple words
  > cgroups decide how much system a process is allowed to use.

if we take Pizza as the system resources (cpu, ram) then with cgroups we slice the pizza and assign one slice per container.

## Where do cgroup live in the filesystem

All cgroup control files are exposed via a special virtual filesystem mounted at **/sys/fs/cgroup**
Depending on the linux version we have two layputs for cgroup:

### 1️⃣ cgroups v1 (older / still common in some setups)

Resources are separated by subsystem.
```bash
/sys/fs/cgroup/
├── cpu/
├── memory/
├── pids/
├── blkio/
├── cpuset/
└── devices/
```
Lets say a docker container exist with id as abc1234. The memory limit will be stored in a file called **memory.limit_in_bytes**
and will be stored on a path that looks like:
```bash
/sys/fs/cgroup/memory/docker/abc1234/memory.limit_in_bytes
```
cpu limit will be stored in the file named **cpu.cfs_quota_us** and will be stored on:
```bash
/sys/fs/cgroup/memory/docker/abc1234/cpu.cfs_quota_us
```

PID limit:
```bash
/sys/fs/cgroup/memory/docker/abc1234/pids.max
```

### 2️⃣ cgroups v2 (modern unified hierarchy)

Most modern distros + Kubernetes use this now.

Single hierarchy:

  ## What resource cgroups control
  ---

  ### CPU

  This includes:
  - CPU shares(priority)
  - CPU quotas(hard limits)
  - CPU pinning(specific cores)

  ```bash
  docker run --cpus=1 nginx
  ```
  This command would ensure that the nginx container can use only 1 cpu core.

  ### RAM

  ```bash
  docker run -m 512m nginx
  ```
  This will make sure that the container will not be able to use more than 512 mb of ram.
  If it tries to do so, linux has a built in mechanism called **OOM(out of memory)** killer.
  This will be used by the kernel to enforce the cgroup rule and to kill the container.
