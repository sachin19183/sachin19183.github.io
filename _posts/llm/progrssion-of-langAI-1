## Bag of Words

Bag of Words (BoW) is a technique used for representing unstructured text. It originated in the 1950s but became widely popular in the early 2000s.

It provides a simple way to understand early text processing and how modern LLMs evolved over time.

### How it works

1. **Tokenize** the sentences provided as input.  
   Example:  
   `"Hello, how are you? Are you from India?"`  
   becomes  
   `"Hello"`, `","`, `"how"`, `"are"`, `"you"`, `"?"`, `"Are"`, `"you"`, `"from"`, `"India"`, `"?"`

2. All the **unique tokens** form the **vocabulary**.  
   Example vocabulary:  
   `"Hello"`, `"how"`, `"are"`, `"you"`, `"Are"`, `"from"`, `"India"`, `","`, `"?"`

3. Using the vocabulary, count the **frequency** of each word in the input.  
   This creates a numeric **vector representation** of text.

### Limitations

- Space as a delimiter doesn’t work in languages like Mandarin.
- Completely ignores the **meaning** and **context** of words.
- Treats language as just a bag of words — order doesn’t matter.

➡️ This highlights how intelligent humans really are when understanding language 😄

## Word2Vec

In 2013, **Word2Vec** became one of the first highly successful techniques for capturing **semantics** using **word embeddings** — numeric vectors that encode meaning.

It is trained using **large corpora** of text (e.g., Wikipedia) using **neural networks** with weights (parameters) between layers.

### How it learns semantic meaning

Word2Vec learns by observing which words frequently appear near each other.

Example sentence:  
> “The cat sat on the mat.”

- “cat” is near “sat”
- “mat” is near “sat”
- “cat” and “mat” appear in similar contexts → **similar meanings**

Initially, every word gets a random vector like:
